"""Even tile-grid layout — the ``TILE_GRID_MODE="even"`` alternative.

The legacy ``axis_positions`` walks a fixed stride and clamps the last tile to
the edge, so all layout slack piles up in the final step: width 976 with tile
384 / stride 288 yields positions ``(0, 288, 576, 592)`` — the 4th column is
shifted 16 px and ~96% duplicates the 3rd. This module distributes the
MINIMAL number of tiles uniformly instead, with the overlap never dropping
below a floor.

The layout is computed in integer units of the VAE spatial factor, so every
position is factor-aligned by construction and the guarantees are exact (no
floating-point edge cases): full coverage, gaps within one unit of each
other, per-gap overlap >= ``min_overlap``, and never more tiles than the
legacy walk. Where the legacy stride divides the span exactly (all current
production shapes) the tile count is unchanged.

    Uses the minimal position count whose uniform stride keeps the tile
    overlap at or above ``min_overlap``, then spreads the positions evenly
    over ``[0, length - tile]`` in integer ``snap`` units. When ``length`` or
    ``tile`` is not ``snap``-aligned the same layout is computed at pixel
    precision (``snap=1``) — the latent-grid guard downstream still enforces
    alignment where it actually matters (the LU path).
