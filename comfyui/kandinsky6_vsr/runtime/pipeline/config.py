"""Configuration for the K6 super-resolution pipeline.

:class:`SRConfig` is the single source of tunable SR settings. Defaults live
on the model; a YAML config (the ``sr:`` section of a k6 pipeline YAML, or a
standalone SR YAML with the same section) overrides them, and explicit CLI
options override the YAML. Model-contract constants (trained fps/frame
budget, resolutions, delivery tiers) are NOT configurable — they live in
:mod:`kandinsky_sr.constants`.
