"""Final-output sizing: bring the SR result down to an exact delivery resolution.

Tiled SR always produces ``source * scale`` pixels — a size dictated by the
tiling invariant (``tile * scale == base``), not by the product. A 432x768
source at x2 yields 864x1536 where the deliverable is 720x1280; a 480x864
source at x2.25 yields 1088x1952 where it is 1080x1920. This module maps that
raw result onto one of the shipped tiers (see ``TARGET_RESOLUTIONS``).

Resize only — no cropping. Where the SR aspect differs slightly from the tier
(a 1.8 source against 16:9, ~1%), the scale is very mildly anisotropic instead
of throwing pixels away; the mismatch is logged so it stays visible.

Downscaling is antialiased and runs in frame chunks — a 2K result is a couple
of GB as uint8 and four times that as float, so a single ``interpolate`` over
the whole clip would spike memory for no reason.

    A tier name (``hd`` / ``fullhd`` / ``2k``) resolves against the SR result's

    closest-aspect rule the tiling uses to choose a base resolution. An

    ``mode`` then decides how the bucket is honoured: ``"fit"`` (the default)
