"""Offload contract consumed by the SR pipeline stages.

The SR package never decides *how* modules are offloaded; the embedding
application (for example the K6 pipeline) builds a concrete handle and injects
it into :func:`kandinsky_sr.pipeline.factory.load_sr_pipeline`. Stages only
rely on this structural protocol, so any object exposing ``register`` / ``use``
/ ``release`` works. :class:`NoOpOffload` is the default when nothing is injected.
